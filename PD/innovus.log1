**ERROR: (IMPEXT-3491):	Extraction failed because Quantus QRC technology file(s) are not specified for all the active RC corners in the MMMC set up. This is mandatory for medium or high or signoff effortLevel postRoute extraction. If all files are unavailable, set 'setExtractRCMode -effortLevel low'.

**WARN: (IMPESI-2017):	There is no coupling capacitance found in the design. Use 'setDelayCalMode -siAware false' to perform base delay analysis.
